7650,51 The specific situation of the outermost regions is recognised in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union The energy sector in the outermost regions is often characterised by isolation limited supply and dependence on fossil fuels while these regions benefit from important local renewable sources of energy The outermost regions could thus serve as examples of the application of innovative energy technologies for the Union It is therefore necessary to promote the uptake of renewable energy in order to achieve a higher degree of energy autonomy for those regions and recognise their specific situation in terms of renewable energy potential and public support needs Provision should be made for a derogation of limited local impact that allows Member States to adopt specific criteria in order to ensure eligibility for financial support for the consumption of certain biomass fuels Member States should be able to adopt such specific criteria for installations using biomass fuel and located in an outermost region as referred to in Article 349 TFEU as well as for biomass that is used as fuel in the said intallations and that does not comply with the harmonised sustainability energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions savings criteria of this Directive Such specific criteria for biomass fuels should apply irrespective of the place origin of that biomass in any Member State or third country Moreover any specific criteria should be objectively justified for reasons of energy independence of the outermost region concerned and of ensuring a smooth transition to the sustainability energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biomass fuels of this Directive in such an outermost region Considering that the energy mix for electricity generation for the outermost regions is essentially made up to a large extent of fuel oil it is necessary to allow to appropriately consider greenhouse gas emissions saving critera in these regions It would therefore be appropriate to provide a specific fossil fuel comparator for the electricity produced in the outermost regions Member States should ensure effective compliance with the specific criteria which they adopted,0,2016/0382(COD)_80,0,Council
