For the present, the Union has not exercised the shared competence on traffic rights and where the Union and Member States have concluded a comprehensive air transport agreement with a third country, Member States may grant further traffic rights bilaterally beyond what is included in the agreement. An adoption of redressive measures might affect tenets of the bilateral aviation relationship between Member States and third countries, in particular where no comprehensive air transport agreement is in place.

As such, connectivity is directly linked to the vital national interests of Member States performance of both local and national economies. The possible decrease in air connectivity which might be caused by the adoption of measures against third country air operators in a case of unfair competition could affects the wider economic environment at regional and national level opportunities for local industries, businesses as well as consumers and citizens.

Such specific criteria for biomass fuels should apply irrespective of the place origin of that biomass in any Member State or third country. Moreover, any specific criteria should be objectively justified for reasons of energy independence of the outermost region concerned and of ensuring a smooth transition to the sustainability, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for biomass fuels of this Directive in such an outermost region. Considering that the energy mix for electricity generation for the outermost regions is essentially made up to a large extent of fuel oil, it is necessary to allow to appropriately consider greenhouse gas emissions saving critera in these regions.
